Gah!

I tried to install
[VisitorComments](http://plone.org/products/visitorcomments) to allow
anonymous users to leave their name when they commented blog entries.

By some, yet to be known, reason, this f\*cked up my something in the
blog, so comments are now added to the root of the blog instead of to
the relevant entry. Uninstalling VisitorComments didn't help :-(.

This seems to be a known problem according to Olivier Ozoux on the
quills mailing list, but his proposed solution - to remove the blog and
then re-post all the entries, doesn't work for me, now when I decided to
give it a try, even though it's a rather annoying thing to do..
