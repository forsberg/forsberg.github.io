-   [ZPhotoSlides](http://www.zphotoalbum.org): Well, seems rather
    competent. Documentation hints about ability to read photos from
    file system, but how? Very hard to understand where to find that
    functionality. That would be very useful, though.

    Adding a ZPhotoSlidesFolder doesn't seem to work at all, possibly
    because of trying to use ZPhotoSlides under Plone 2.1.

    Webpage of product seems to be quite outdated. The only "working
    demo" of version 2.0 gives a 404. Hmm..

-   [AT Photo Album](http://plone.org/products/atphotoalbum): Adding an
    AtPhotoAlbum object gives me a folder-like object without any
    possibility to edit anything. I think product is not Plone
    2.1-ready.

-   [ATPhoto](http://plone.org/products/atphoto): Doesn't seem to have
    much functionality. Fails to display the single photo I added in
    view mode.

-   CMFPhotoAlbum: 0.5.0 fails to install due to missing
    navigation\_properties in Plone 2.1. Trunk from SVN installs, but
    trying to add a Photo Album gives a 404.

    Trying to find the canonical web page for CMFPhotoAlbum seems
    impossible.

-   The built in photo album view in Plone 2.1 is not good enough for my
    demands.

Nah, I'll stick with the album generated by
[Kofoto](http://kofoto.rosdahl.net) for a while. [Here's my
photos](http://efod.se/photos).
