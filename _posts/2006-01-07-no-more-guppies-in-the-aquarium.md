I gave away my [guppies](http://zoopet.com/fiskar/fisk.php?NR=34) today
to a guy I know from LysKOM. He had a brand new tank and wanted some
free fish for it.

That's a good solution. I didn't want the guppies, but I'm not
steel-hearted enough to kill them. Now they'll get a nice new home :-).

Now I'll have to think about what other fish I can add to my tank.
