By randomly following links in [deliiciouus](http://del.icio.us), I
stumbled into [this article about the inner workings of the Death
Star](http://science.howstuffworks.com/death-star.htm) on
[Howstuffworks](http://howstuffworks.com).

That was the first laugh. Very interesting article, and it's funny that
[Howstuffworks](http://howstuffworks.com) has an article on this issue
:-).

The article about the Death Star lead me further to [this article about
the inappropriates of the waste disposal system on the Death
Star](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/2002/01/10deathstar.html). Also very
funny :-).
