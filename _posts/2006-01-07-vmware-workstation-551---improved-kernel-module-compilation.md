Wohoo! Just upgraded to [VMware](http://www.vmware.com) Workstation
5.5.1 at work (where I use VMware *a lot* for testing
[ThinLinc](http://www.cendio.se/products/thinlinc) features on different
operating systems).

The best feature with 5.5.1 compared to version I ran previously is that
it manages to compile its kernel modules for the stock Debian 2.6.8-2
kernel. Earlier, I had to run 2.6.8-1 for this to work, with known
security holes :-(.

I generally try to use Open Source software, but VMware is one of the
exceptions. Especially since my employer pays the license.. :-)
