Just got back from watching the Narnia movie.

Great stuff. I'd say it's not as good as, but still in the same division
as Lord of the rings. A lot of beautiful scenery and heavy battle
scenes. Definitely a film that you want to see in a large movie theater
with good sound and large screen!

The pre-movie commercials were (among other things) for the *Da Vinci
Code*. I may actually go see it, even though the book is irritating to
read - Dan Brown simply isn't a good writer. The story is quite OK, but
his english and book-writing skills are not. I've actually read some of
his other books as well, both *Deception Point* and *Digital Fortress*,
and I have to say that both of them suck bigtime!

I hope they have managed to make the Da Vinci movie better than the book
- with Audrey Tautou, Jean Reno and Tom Hanks, one could hope it's not a
total pain to view.
