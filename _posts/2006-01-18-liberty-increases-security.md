Found a link to [this blog
entry](http://riskman.typepad.com/perilocity/2006/01/liberty_is_secu.html)
in the [blog of Bruce
Schneier](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/01/liberty_increas.html).
It's about research showing that countries with limited liberty are good
at producing terrorists, while countries that may be poor but with a
tradition of protecting civil liberties are less likely to produce
terrorists.

This is worth thinking about, in a time where every government
(including the swedish, especially our dear minister of Justice -Thomas
Bodstr√∂m, who is trying very hard to impress his idols in the U.S.
government) seems eager to limit the liberty of their citizens in the
"war against terrorism".

Perhaps the billions spent on listening to decent people's phone calls
and bombing empty caves in Afghanistan, would have been better spent in
supporting development of societies with lot's of freedom?
