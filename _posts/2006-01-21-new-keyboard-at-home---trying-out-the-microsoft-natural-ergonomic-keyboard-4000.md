I accidentally poured too much water into my old trusty MS Natural
Keyboard (bought sometime in 1999 or so). Very sad, since I very much
enjoyed it. I still use this kind of keyboard at work, though.

I tried to take it apart to let it dry, but unfortunately, it didn't
help. Must be some corrosion somewhere in the layers of metal-covered
plastic that keep track of which key was pressed, since only some of the
keys are malfunctioning.

As a side note, the old keyboard had the text "Keytronics" printed on
some of its internal parts.

Since I've really enjoyed this keyboard, I decided to try the new
generation of MS Natural Keyboard, and tried a MS Natural Ergonomic
Keyboard 4000 at a local hardware store. It felt nice, so I bought it.

I unpacked it yesterday, and to much irritation, the F3-F12 buttons
didn't work at all, not giving any keycode back. Mumbling about
Microsoft doing stupid things, I went to bed.

This morning, after doing some google queries, I found out that you must
have the "F Lock" button pressed to get all F-keys working. Not 100%
obvious, if you ask me.. but I guess that's what I guess for not
following the instructions about installing the software before plugging
the keyboard in. Not that I expect a Linux version of the software on
the CD.. :-)

There are some keys on the keyboard that don't give any keysyms,
including the zoom key in the middle. There seems to be ongoing work on
a Linux driver for this hardware, that will enable this as well. All
important keys do however work.

So, what about the ergonomics and feeling of the keyboard? Well, after
typing a while, my initial impression is that I really like it. I've had
to adjust my armrest's positions a bit to compensate for the slightly
higher keyboard (I'm currently trying it using the piece of plastic that
makes it higher in the end faced to me. It does make the keyboard look
like an UFO, but it feels right!).

The feeling of each keystroke is quite similar to the old one, perhaps
being a little bit softer. The space button is a bit harder to press
down, and the enter key is a bit smaller, but so far, I haven't managed
to hit it.

I usually don't enjoy products from Microsoft, being a user mostly of
Linux and other UNIX derivatives, but their keyboards are very good.
