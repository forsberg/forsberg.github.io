My Girlfriend is very interested in knitting. Today, she took the [What
Kind of Knitter Are
You](http://www.quizilla.com/users/sdamot/quizzes/What%20Kind%20of%20Knitter%20Are%20You%3F)
test at [quizillaccom](http://www.quizilla.com), and was rated *Knitting
Guru*. I think the best sentence from the motivation was *It can be hard
to tell where the yarn ends and you begin*.

How very true. For example, every time I want to sit in our livingroom
couch, I must be very careful to make sure I don't sit on one of the
several knitting needles that are very often located there. Not to
mention that I found some traces of yarn in the freezer the other day.

But I'm not complaining - I have my habits as well..
