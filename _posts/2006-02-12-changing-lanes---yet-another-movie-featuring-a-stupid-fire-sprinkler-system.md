Gah! Watched *Changing Lanes* yesterday. It was quite OK, especially
since I was quite tired - any movie would probably have done :-).

In one of the scenes, Ben Affleck triggers a fire sprinkler with a
burning piece of paper. And as usual, every sprinkler on the floor
starts spreading huge amounts on water over everything, and everyone has
to evacutate, which is very convenient for Affleck's role person since
he can then go and read some secret file in the office of his boss. Oh
well..

I'm sorry, Hollywood, but fire sprinklers simply don't work that way.
Read [this page](http://www.sprinklernet.org/press/facts.html) for
example, where its clearly stated that only the sprinklers that are
activated by the fire's heat will start spreading water. Usually, each
sprinkler has a valve that is opened when a small pipe filled with a
fluid is destroyed when the fluid expands because of the heat.

By the way, *The Matrix* also has stupid movie sprinklers - they're even
more stupid, because all the sprinklers in the whole building are
activated when one sprinkler goes off.
