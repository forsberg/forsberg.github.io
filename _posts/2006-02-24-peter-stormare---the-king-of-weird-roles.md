Watched [The Brothers Grimm](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0355295/) on
DVD. Peter Stormare is really the King of Weird Roles. In this movie
He's playing a very Monty Python'ish italian guy, specializing in the
art of torture. I also remember him as the weird eye doctor in [Minority
Report](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181689/) - it's very funny when his
assistant is singing "Små Grodorna, Små Grodorna" :-).
