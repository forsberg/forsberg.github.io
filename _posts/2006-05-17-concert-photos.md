The excellent male choir [Lihkören](http://www.lihkoren.se/) offered me
two free tickets to their spring concert at the end of April in exchange
for me taking some photos from the Concert. This was an offer I couldn't
refuse! :-)

Not only [Lihkören](http://www.lihkoren.se/) were performing on this
concert, the A Capella group [Riltons
Vänner](http://www.riltonsvanner.com) were there as their guests. That
was a very pleasant surprise - I really have to recommend this group,
they do fantastic music!
