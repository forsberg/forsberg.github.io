My girlfriend enjoys watching Gilmore Girls on TV. I don't, but given
the size of our apartment, I get to hear the conversation quite often..

One thing confuses me with the people in this sitcom - they talk 100% of
the time. There's never time to breathe! How do they do it? Are they
aliens equipped absorbing air via their feet, or do the actors have
small tubes with air they insert into their lungs before recording every
episode?

Must be painful.
