Now and then, I've made half an attempt to make my Gnus archive messages
in an IMAP box, but so far, I've failed with various spectacular error
messages.

Today I managed to get just the right keywords in my google query, and
ended up at [this blog post](http://blogs.openaether.org/?p=117), which
gave the answer:

It seems to work, even after a restart of emacs. The real test is to see
if it works tomorrow too! :-)

The funny part is that [the blog
post](http://blogs.openaether.org/?p=117) actually refers to my page on
[Gnus+nnimap+Courier
IMAP+SSL](http://efod.se/writings/gnus-and-courier). It's always funny
when you're referred back to your own pages when looking for information
about something you need help with :-).
