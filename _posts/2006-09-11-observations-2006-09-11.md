Some notes from todays work..

-   eDirectory is actually smart enough to keep track of alias objects.
    If you move or delete an object, the alias is updated/removed.

-   It's not at all recommended to try major upgrades of a remote Linux
    machine when the network goes up, down, up, down, up, down. Bah!

-   SOAP, which is an acronym for *Simple Object Access Protocol*, is of
    course, as many other protocols which has a name with *Simple*, not
    simple at all.

-   The SOAP implementation in SugarCRM has (at least one) bug. It
    doesn't send along a non-empty error field in the response to
    get\_module\_fields(). See [this
    bug](http://www.sugarcrm.com/crm/?option=com_sugarbugs&task=view&caseID=ce7902d7-c093-7550-53a6-4505bab33f84)
    for a patch.
