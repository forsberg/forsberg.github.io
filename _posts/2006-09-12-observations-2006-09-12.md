Some notes from todays work...

-   Don't interrupt a running *yum update* with *kill -9*, that messes
    up things. Had to reinstall some, and remove some, packages,
    upgrading a machine from CentOS 4.3 to 4.4. Oh well..

    Btw, the error message from yum when it can't find any mirrors due
    to the nameserver being completely down is.. confusing! I don't have
    it here, though.

    YUM delenda est.

-   Playing around with SOAP, talking to SugarCRM, got much easier after
    reading the "guide.pdf", which is unfortunately only available in
    the mail archive (and I can't find a web archive with the pdf
    available to link to). Hopefully, it'll be added to the [pywebsvcs
    web pages](http://pywebsvcs.sf.net) soon.

I'm thinking about writing a SugarCRM plugin for opensync. That would be
cool. And useful. The [code for
moto-sync](http://www.opensync.org/browser/plugins/moto-sync), in
Python, is very readable and could serve as an example.
