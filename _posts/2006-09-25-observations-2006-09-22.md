-   The correct settings for talking to a Fujitsu-Siemens Primepower 250
    (or a Sun VFire 250, or probably any sun) via the serial console
    port is 9600 8N1, no software handshake, no hardware handshake.

-   You know you're dealing with serious hardware when there's a setting
    for altitude in the system configuration. The Primepower 250 uses
    this setting to calculate how much the fans should rotate for a
    given system temperature.

-   Minicom does not handle UTF-8 xterm's or tty's very well.. LANG=C is
    recommended.
