I just ordered a [KiSS
DP-588](http://www.kiss-technology.com/?p=dvd3&v=users). It's a
networked DVD-player with harddrive recorder. I have a colleague who has
one, and he's very satisfied with it.

I'm afraid this will mean I'll no longer miss a single Mythbuster
episode :-).

Hopefully it won't mean I spend more time watching TV, just that I watch
more on TV programmes I really want to see.
