Just found out about [Kivaoorg](http://www.kiva.org), an organization
that gives micro-loans to poor people around the world.

The ideas is that you, yeah, you, go there and lend a small amount of
money, say $25, to one of the businesses that need a loan. The loan is
then transferred to the business in question via partners in the
country, and the money is put to use. You will then get updates on how
the business proceeds.

Once the loan is repayed, you get your money back. You can then choose
to lend the money to another business, or get it back via Paypal.

Nice! I just lended $25 to a [company in
Uganda](http://www.kiva.org/app.php?page=businesses&action=about&id=908)
using my VISA card. I can do without that small amount, and the reward
from helping someone in need is worth a lot!
