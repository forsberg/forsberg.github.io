I spoke to a customer today. He's head of the IT department for a
middle-sized organization with 6000 users.

He had a project going on with the goal of finding and implementing a
document management system for the whole organization.

The project group had reported back to him telling him that they had
found three (yes, *3*) candidates, and that the candidate they thought
was best was some Microsoft product.

He was a little bit puzzled that they only had found three candidates. I
had to agree, so I immediately made a quick search on
[Freshmeat](http://freshmeat.net) for [document
management](http://freshmeat.net/search/?q=document+management&section=projects&Go.x=0&Go.y=0)
and got 105 hits.

I think this reflects a problem that the open source world has to pay
more attention to - people *don't know* that there are alternatives to
the products from Microsoft and the other big companies with large PR
budgets.
