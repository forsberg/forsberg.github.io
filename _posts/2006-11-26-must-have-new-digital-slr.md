My neighbours (and friends) Ola and Karin just got their Canon EOS 400D.

Boy, that piece is WAY FASTER than my poor EOS 300D. It's probably so
much faster that I'll have to upgrade.

The lack of speed on the 300D, when taking pictures in serial or when
viewing them on the display is very irritating, but it seems like Canon
has managed to beef up the processing speed to fully acceptable levels
in the 400D, even for RAW images.

Photography is one of these hobbies where the risk of having to open up
your wallet now and then is very high..

**Update**: Oops, raised the Canon model number +50 by mistake =).
