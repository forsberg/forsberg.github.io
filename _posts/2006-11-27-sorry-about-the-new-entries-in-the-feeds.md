An excuse to those of my readers who get this blog via one of the
syndication feeds (RSS,Atom,etc): I'm sorry about all the "new" entries
yesterday and today. I've upgraded my blog software and removed lots of
spam, and that caused the timestamps of the entries to be updated, which
triggered new publication in the feeds.
