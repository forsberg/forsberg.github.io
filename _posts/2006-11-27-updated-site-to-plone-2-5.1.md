I finally have upgraded this site to Plone 2.5.1. There's no big changes
for the casual viewer. About the only visual changes are in the blog,
which I've upgraded from Quills 0.9 to Quills trunk. In the non-visual
department, the syndication feeds now contain category names, which will
make [technorati](http://technorati.com) happier. Speaking of technorati
- I wonder why it doesn't pick up changes to this blog. \

The blog software upgrade was not completely painless, so to speak. All
entries in the blog were flagged by new in the syndication feeds, not to
mention that they were displayed as html code. That problem went away
when upgrading the basesyndication product as well.\
\
I honestly don't know if this problem is present in Quills 1.5RC3, as I
had some other strange error there. I do however think this was more
related to a locally modified template.\
\
Oh well. \
