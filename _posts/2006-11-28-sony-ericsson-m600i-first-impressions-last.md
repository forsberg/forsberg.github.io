Got a new phone at work today, a [Sony Ericsson
M600i](http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=se&lc=sv&ver=4000&template=pp1_loader&php=php1_10385&zone=pp&lm=pp1&pid=10385).
It's a 3G phone. Unfortunately, our cellular network provider
([Tele2](http://www.tele2.se)) requires you to change SIM-card to a new
one when you want to use 3G instead of just GSM. The SIM-card has been
ordered and will probably be in my hands tomorrow.

Eager to begin playing, erm, I mean *working*. with this new toy, erm, I
mean *"critical tool for my working environment"*, I tried to insert the
GSM SIM-card I already had. It seemed to work well.\
\
However, after a while, I noticed that the symbol for network coverage
was going up, then down, then up, then down. Also, initiating calls only
worked 1 out of 10 atttempts.\
\
I phoned (one of the ten attempts) to the customer service, and they
were quite sure the problem is that the phone simply doesn't work well
with a GSM card.\
\
Gah! How hard can it be to make a phone that works with GSM SIM-cards?
I'm just asking! If the SIM-card says that it's just GSM, then use just
GSM, and don't try to get 3G access. **Grr!**\
\
On the same level of stupidity, it seems like you need to have a
SIM-card inserted into the phone to be able to access anything else than
the welcome screens (and possibly the emergency number, 112). That's
very well thought out, since you also need a SIM-card to be able to
transfer contacts etc. from your old phone to your new one via Bluetooth
or IR. So, if you only have one SIM card, you have no simple way to
transfer your contacts.\
\
Stupid!\
\
Apart from that, it seems to be a nice phone. I'll probably be back
later with some more reviews of its functionality. Hopefully, I'll be
able to synchronize it with some desktop application on Linux. \
