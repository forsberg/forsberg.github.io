The weather in LInk√∂ping is really cool right now. There's a major storm
(weather service warns about 30m/s winds) and some rain. \

Perfect weather for some programming. Currently working on the [new
tracker for
python-dev](http://psf.upfronthosting.co.za/roundup/tracker/) (based on
[roundup](http://roundup.sf.net))\
\
Now, let's hope the power grid doesn't fail. About 120.000 people in
Sweden have no electricity right now.\
