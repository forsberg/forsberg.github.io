Bought a book ([Web Component Development with Zope
3](http://worldcookery.com)) on [amazon.co.uk](http://amazon.co.uk). A
few days later, I got a mail from amazon with six recommendations for
other books they thought I might like.

I already own two of them. Obviously I fit some kind of profile. Scary.\
