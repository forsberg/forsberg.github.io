There are so many interesting books I want to read that I often end up
reading several books at once. Here's my current list of unfinished
titles:

\

-   George Monbiot, [HEAT - How to stop the planet
    burning](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Heat-How-Stop-Planet-Burning/dp/0713999233)\
    Very interesting study on how we can stop emitting too much carbon
    dioxide while still keeping most of our lifestyle. On the same
    matter, there's a [interesting
    article](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1064&a=610609) in
    todays paper about the use of ethanol as fuel for cars. In short,
    the article claims that since the production of ethanol consumes
    more energy than the amount of energy available in the fuel when it
    reaches the consumer, using ethanol as vehicle fuel is simply not
    doable. I'm not surprised. \
-   Philipp von Weitershausen, [Web Component Development with
    Zope3](http://worldcookery.com)\
    Very well-written book on how to develop with Zope3.\
-   Bruce Tate, [Beyond
    Java](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/beyondjava/)\
    This author, who has been a great fan of Java for many years, comes
    to the conclusion that for many purposes, it's not the best
    language. No shit, sherlock. \
-   Andrew Hunt and David Thomas, [Pragmatic Unit
    Testing](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/starter_kit/utj/index.html)\
    Although written with JUnit as example unit test framework, this
    book is supposed to contain good info on how to think when writing
    unit tests, regardless of which language you're using.
-   [Eric Meyer on CSS](http://www.ericmeyeroncss.com/)\
    Interesting book on how to use CSS. \
-   Jan Guillou,
    [Tempelriddaren](http://www.piratforlaget.se/sidor/bspjgu4.html)\
    Fiction, in swedish. It's the second time I read it.\

There's so much to learn in this world.\
