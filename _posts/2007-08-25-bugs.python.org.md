For over a year, I've been working on replacing the bug tracker used by
the [python](http://python.org) project. Earlier, they used the horrible
bug tracker provided by sourceforge. Now, since last thursday, they are
using their own tracker based on [roundup](http://roundup.sf.net).

Hooray! I'm very happy we're finally there! \

The new tracker is at [http://bugs.python.org](http://bugs.python.org)
