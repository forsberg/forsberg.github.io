In todays issue of [Dagens Nyheter](http://www.dn.se), the largest
morning paper in Sweden, an article about pensions caught my eye, not so
much because of the subject, but because of the URLs they referred to in
the article. Here are the three URLs they referred to:

-   [http://www.collectum.se](http://www.collectum.se)
-   [http://www.collectum.se/templates/Page\_\_\_\_13901.aspx](http://www.collectum.se/templates/Page____13901.aspx)
-   [http://www.collectum.se/default\_v2\_\_\_\_13883.aspx](http://www.collectum.se/default_v2____13883.aspx)

The first one is OK from a user interface perspective, but the second
and the third one made me chuckle, especially as the second one actually
had a note which freely translated went something like *"Note that four
underline characters are needed for the direct link to work"*. \
\
Clearly, the people who designed this web site have not read neither
[Jakob Nielsen's "URL as UI"](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/990321.html)
nor [W3C's "Cool URIs don't
change"](http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI). I guess they never
thought about being referred to from a newspaper in print where people
actually have to type their URLs into their web browser. \
\
Dagens Nyheter tries to make the situation better by providing a link to
their online version of the article at
[dn.se/pensionskryss](http://dn.se/pensionskryss), which indeed makes it
a bit easier for the readers to click the links. Sadly, the webmasters
of Dagens Nyheter haven't done their homework either - the link is just
a redirect to the article, which has this beautful URL:
[http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=547&a=692119](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=547&a=692119).
So, let's say that you saved a bookmark to the article, and want to
refer a friend of yours by word of mouth a week later when you have
forgotten that there was a human-friendly link available - now you
**must** send the link via e-mail or other electronic media. Simply
telling your friend over the phone is completely impossible, which it
would not have been if the link were something like
*http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/2007/09/16/pension*.\
\
Oh well.. the world is far from perfect. Happily, at work, we're using a
content management system that automatically creates URLs that look
nice: [Plone](http://plone.org).\
