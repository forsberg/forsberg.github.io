When I woke up this morning, the last dream was still left in my head.
It was, as all dreams, strange:\

*I stood on some kind of barricade, shouting out to the world that I was
so frustrated about not being able to get IPv6 connectivity to my alarm
clock.*

Strange indeed.

I do have IPv6 connectivity to my home workstation via
[http://www.sixxs.net,](http://www.sixxs.net) but the alarm clock is not
connected. Yet.\
