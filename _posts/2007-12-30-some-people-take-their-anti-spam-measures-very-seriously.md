The municipality of Link√∂ping distributes a magazine, *DIALOG*, to all
its citizens four times a year. The articles are about subjects like the
new fire station, upcoming big events in the city, etc.

There's always a minor section with information on how I can contact my
local politicans. There's a list with the name, a photo, a phone number,
and an e-mail address.

To my surprise, the e-mail addresses were on the form
*givenname.surname&linkoping.se* - that is, they had replaced the **@**
sign with an **&** sign.**In a publication printed on paper!**

There's even an explanation at the end of the page *"because of a
decision in the municipal council, @ has been replaced by &"*.

One has to wonder what they are afraid of - that someone will scan the
paper, run it through OCR, and place the result somewhere on the
internet? \

Of course, the real reason is either that the municipal council made a
very bad decision because they don't know that they are doing, or that
someone has misinterpreted the decision. Either way, the result is a
usability disaster - not all people know how to properly format an
e-mail address.\
