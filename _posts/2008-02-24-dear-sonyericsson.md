*Dear SonyEricsson. \
*

*May I please suggest that you test your applications, for example the
SMS and Phonebook applications, with a realistic amount of data added to
their databases. This will lead to less frustrations among your
customers because they won't have to wait for ages each time they want
to read an SMS or find a contact in their phonebook. , It may even lead
to customers buying another SonyEricsson the next time they need a new
phone!\
*

*Best Regards,\
\\EF - Unhappy user of SonyEricsson m600i.*
