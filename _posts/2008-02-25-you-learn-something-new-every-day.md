Today, I found out that different paragraph styles in OpenOffice can
have different languages, which is the reason why the
*Tools-\>Options-\>Language-\>Languages* setting flips back when you
change it. You need to modify the language in the popup that appears
when you press F11. Right-click on a paragraph style and choose
*Modify*, then go to the Font tab. There it is!
