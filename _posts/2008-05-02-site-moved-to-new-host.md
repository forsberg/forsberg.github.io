I just moved this site to a new host, for two reasons - the first being
that it is boring to keep physical hardware running, so I'm now running
on a Xen slice I rent from [Slicehost](http://www.slicehost.com). The
second reason is to be announced soon..

It actually seems like Plone 2.5 can run on a machine with only 256Mb of
memory with acceptable performance as long as the CPU is fast.

Please tell me if you find something that doesn't work as intended.
