I've never had any luck with the suspend to disk functionality on Linux,
but now, after upgrade to Ubuntu 8.10, it's working, even at my home
workstation with mirrored disk setup.

Some people had it working years ago, so I guess I've been having bad
luck with my hardware combos or something. Still, this is an area where
Linux has definitely been behind Windows - where this stuff just works.
That is on the other hand probably mostly because the hardware
manufacturers only test on Windows.

Regardless of who's to blame for the previous trouble, I'm happy with
the fact that it's now working - I enjoy being able to shut down the
computer and then start it again in the state I left it. Leaving it on
just for that purpose is not something I want to do, trying as I am to
be a responsible energy consumer.
