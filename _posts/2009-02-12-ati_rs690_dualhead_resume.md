The ATI fglrx driver I run against my ATI RS690 chip in my [dualhead
setup](/blog/archive/2009/02/04/dualhead) definitely has its quirks.
When resuming from disk, both monitors must be turned on when I press
the computer's power button, or the X server will behave very odd.

Hard to describe what happens, but when moving the mouse, the whole
desktop image is moved instead of only the mouse pointer.

Hardware! **I hate hardware!** I want all of it to be emulated in
software.
