I went to a seminar about
[Scrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)) today at
[ENEA](http://www.enea.com/). It was one of those *"let's have a seminar
and then give people free food and beer so they buy more consultants
from us"* type of events.

Even more interesting was the questions after the seminar. Lot's of
people from different tech companies in Link√∂ping. Someone said that
Scrum kept the programmers happy which would produce better code. That's
probably true. Here comes the fun part - another person in the audience
were worried that happy programmers would code things they thought were
fun instead of the things they were supposed to do.

Hmm.. yeah, right. That's the way it works. Or maybe not! I'd say that
the risk is much bigger that *bored* programmers spend their time
working at things they shouldn't do.

I would really like to know where this person works, so I can avoid
working there.
