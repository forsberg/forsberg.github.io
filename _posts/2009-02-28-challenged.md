You talkin' to me? A Blog Challenge? Eh? (Bear, Kolmården Zoo, 2005)

[I have received a
"challenge"](http://deepbluerain.blogspot.com/2009/02/fotoutmaning.html).
Apparently, that's something you do in the blog world. At least, that's
something you do on less nerdy and more frequently updated blogs than
this one.. **;-)**

I'm supposed to take the sixth image in the sixth folder in my photo
collection, post it here with a comment, and then challenge six other
people to do the same thing.

But.. **that's [an Internet
Worm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm)**. Naturally, being a
responsible computer scientist, I can't help spreading a virus! This
blog post is an antivirus.

Still, I'm more than happy to show you, dear reader, some of my
pictures. I'll even write a comment for each and every one of them,
following the rules of the challenge to some point..

The owner of these boats obviously found a theme. Nessebar Bulgaria.
Don't go there, [it's a horrible touristish
place](/blog/archive/2007/08/17/nessebar)

![Sunroofs, Nessebar, Bulgaria](/media/blog/photochallenge/soltak.jpg) \
Sunshades in the morning. Again, this is from Nessebar, Bulgaria, where
you should not go since it's full of tourists and restaurants that all
have EVERYTHING as their speciality. But, if you sneak up at 0600 in the
morning and spend an hour or so taking photos, you can find some nice
angles..

SOF Linköping, 2005 (Student Orchestra Festival).

![Horse](/media/blog/photochallenge/horse.jpg) \
This horse was having lot's of fun, rolling around on the ground. But
now it's decided it's time for some serious.. running around all over
the place!

Bah.. getting tired of finding/scaling images. I could keep on for a
while, with over 11000 images in my image database..

This will have to do. **Not** spreading this virus further by
challenging any other bloggers, at the same time maintaing a high level
of nerdyness!
