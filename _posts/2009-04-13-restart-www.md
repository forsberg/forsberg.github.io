I'm on a [bus4you](http://www.bus4you.se) with destination Oslo for a
visit to [Opera Software's](http://www.opera.com/) main offices. The bus
has wireless internet. That's good, I've been reading webpages on
map-reduce, distributed filesystems and other interesting stuff the
whole trip.

The bus driver mentioned that the network sometimes stops working, and
requires a restart when that happens. It happened, and after confirming
with one of my co-passenges that they too had trouble, I went to tell
the driver.

No problem, he said, I'll restart it. And to restart it, he pressed a
button marked **"WWW"**.

So, if the WWW doesn't work for you, now you know where to find the
button with which it can be restarted - just find the nearest bus4you
bus! :-)
