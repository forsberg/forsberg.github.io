![A norwegian refrigerator](http://efod.se/media/blog/frys.jpg)
The fridge on the picture is probably the most noisy fridge in northern
Europe. You'll find it in one of the rooms at Cochs Pensjonat, Oslo. It
spends its days, and especially nights, starting with a loud bang about
once every 15 minutes, which very effectively wakes people up if they
happen to sleep in the room, something people tend to do in hotel rooms.

Oh, how I love to fill the internet with worthless bullshit!
