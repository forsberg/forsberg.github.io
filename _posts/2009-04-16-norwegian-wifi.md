The hotel where I'm staying in Oslo has a very special kind of Wireless
Internet. It's the kind where you bring your laptop out in the corridor,
connect to the network, and then bring the network with you into your
room.

Connecting directly from the room doesn't work, even though there's
plenty of signal. Well, at least sometimes, there's plenty of signal.
Tonight there is, yesterday night I couldn't see the net.

Must be some norweigan special setup.
