I'm working on a rather large reporting and analytics application that
runs on top of Hadoop at work. It has tests. A whole bunch of them,
actually. That's good.

So far, we've been running the tests manually when making new releases.
But doing it more often is always better, since it gives you an
indication on when things went wrong, and also forces you to keep your
tests in a state where they pass. Some people call it [Continous
Integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration).

Now, you can do all the work getting your builds to build and run tests
yourself, via cron and scripts and other types of messiness. Or you can
try an existing solution. Today I decided to try
[Hudson](http://www.hudson-ci.org/).

That turned out to be embarrasingly simple to get started with.
Basically, it's a matter of:

1.  Downloading hudson.war from their site.
2.  Start it by running *java -jar hudson.war*
3.  Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with a web
    browser of your choice. That would be
    [Opera](http://www.opera.com/browser/) in my case. You have to eat
    your own dog-food.
4.  Go to the Hudson management screen and enable the git plugin
5.  Setup a new project. Tell it where the code is and on which branch.
6.  Configure what commands to run to build and test. Make the test
    command output an xunit xml file.
7.  Tell Hudson where that xml file is.

Result: Hudson will periodically poll git and run my build and test
commands, then show a changelog and what tests failed. All this after 30
minutes of setup time. I'm impressed.
