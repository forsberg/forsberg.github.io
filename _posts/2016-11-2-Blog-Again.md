title: Let's try this blog thing again
---

For a long time, I have not been updating my blog. Yet, I find that I sometimes have stuff I want to write down in a way where the rest of the world can see it. You know, solutions to problems, thoughts, etc.

So let's try again, this time with Jekyll and github pages. Seems convenient, but we'll see.
